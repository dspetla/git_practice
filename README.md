# Hello Git and GitHub
This is my first README, so don't kill me for it.

## Usage
This project was created so that I can learn how to use Git and GitHub. There is no other purpose for it.

## Requirements
    * Nothing is required, really.
    * You only need your laptop,
    * internet connection
    * GitHub, and
    * a bucket of nerves.

## License
I've been wondering about what the MIT license is all about.
